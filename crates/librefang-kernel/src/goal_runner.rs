//! Long-horizon autonomous goal execution (#5744).
//!
//! The Goals system (CRUD + dashboard) tracks objectives but, on its own, is
//! purely passive — nothing ever drives an agent toward a goal. The
//! [`GoalRunner`] closes that gap: starting a run for a goal with an assigned
//! agent spawns a bounded loop that repeatedly prompts the agent with the
//! goal's context and parses the agent's reply for progress / completion
//! markers, updating the goal in the shared memory store until the goal is
//! done, the iteration cap is hit, an operator stops it, or the kernel shuts
//! down.
//!
//! ## Why response markers instead of a tool
//!
//! The agent reports progress by ending its turn with structured lines:
//!
//! ```text
//! GOAL_PROGRESS: 60
//! GOAL_DONE          (optional — signals the goal is complete)
//! GOAL_BLOCKED       (optional — signals it cannot proceed without input)
//! ```
//!
//! This keeps the v1 runner entirely kernel-side: no new runtime tool, no
//! tool-registry / capability-permission surgery. The parsing is forgiving
//! (case-insensitive, last marker wins) so an agent that forgets the marker
//! simply keeps iterating to the cap rather than failing.
