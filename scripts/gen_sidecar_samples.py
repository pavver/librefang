"""Generate the per-adapter `[[sidecar_channels]]` comment blocks
that get pasted into `librefang.toml.example` and
`crates/librefang-cli/templates/init_default_config.toml`.

Source of truth for every block is the adapter's own `SCHEMA`
declaration — pulled via `python3 -m librefang.sidecar.adapters.<name>
--describe`. Keeping the sample SCHEMA-driven means a new adapter
landing (or an existing one rotating an env var) only needs a
re-run of this script; the sample can never silently drift from
the actual env-var contract the adapter enforces at startup.

Usage:

    cd sdk/python
    python3 ../../scripts/gen_sidecar_samples.py > /tmp/blocks.txt

then paste the output between the marker lines in both sample
files and run `cargo xtask schema-check gen` to refresh the
`config.sha256` baseline.

Sanitisation rules — every one is here because the raw SCHEMA
placeholder violated some invariant the sample format requires:

* **Description text**: split on `". "` (period + space) instead
  of just `.` so abbreviations like "Rocket.Chat REST API" don't
  truncate to "Rocket". Trailing `.` from the first sentence is
  dropped to avoid `Name — text..` on render.
* **Display + description**: when the desc is just the display
  name with a generic suffix like "(out-of-process sidecar)",
  drop the suffix — the section header already documents that
  every block in this list is an out-of-process sidecar.
* **Secret values**: render as `"..."` (the dashboard SCHEMA
  hint is free-text prose like "from Settings → Development →
  Your apps" which doesn't belong in a TOML literal). The
  original hint, when meaningful, is preserved as a trailing
  `# <hint>` comment on the same line so operators don't lose
  the semantic guidance.
* **Text-type placeholders** containing `"`: escape via `\\"`.
* **All-optional adapters** (wechat / whatsapp): every env-var
  line is double-commented (`# # KEY = ...  # optional`) plus an
  explicit "Requires at least…" note above the env table — these
  adapters refuse to start with zero config, but the SCHEMA
  marks every var as optional because there are two valid
  configuration paths.
